            <h2>Fitness and Its Impact on Anxiety and Depression</h2>
            <p>While fitness is widely recognized for its mental health benefits, an over-obsession with fitness, particularly among Gen Z, can have adverse effects. This phenomenon can lead to heightened anxiety and depression in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> Social media often portrays unrealistic fitness goals, causing individuals to feel inadequate if they donâ€™t achieve similar results.</li>
                <li><strong>Overtraining Syndrome:</strong> Excessive focus on exercise can result in physical and mental exhaustion, reducing overall well-being.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Spending excessive time on fitness routines may lead to neglect of social relationships, increasing feelings of loneliness.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Dysmorphia:</strong> Constant comparison and obsession over physical appearance can harm self-esteem and trigger depressive episodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure to Perform:</strong> Gen Z faces significant societal pressure to excel in all areas, including fitness, which can lead to overwhelming stress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To combat these issues, it is crucial to focus on balance, self-compassion, and a personalized approach to fitness. Engaging in hobbies, connecting with loved ones, and seeking professional help when needed are essential steps toward a healthier relationship with fitness.</p>

                <li><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Individuals with certain medical conditions may experience complications if fitness routines are not tailored to their needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Pressure:</strong> Unrealistic fitness goals or comparisons with others can lead to negative self-image.</li>
            </ul>
